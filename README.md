# PowerPulse: Household Energy Usage Forecast

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts household energy consumption using historical data. The goal is to provide actionable insights into energy usage trends and deliver an accurate predictive model for optimizing energy consumption.

## Project Objectives
- Develop an accurate prediction model for household power consumption.
- Provide clear insights into key factors influencing energy usage.
- Visualize energy trends and predictive performance.

## Problem Statement
Energy management is crucial for both households and energy providers. Accurate predictions of energy consumption enable better planning, cost reduction, and resource optimization.

## Business Use Cases
1. **Energy Management for Households:** Monitor energy usage, reduce bills, and promote energy-efficient habits.
2. **Demand Forecasting for Energy Providers:** Predict demand for better load management and pricing strategies.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Identify irregular patterns indicating faults or unauthorized usage.
4. **Smart Grid Integration:** Enable predictive analytics for real-time energy optimization.

## Technical Approach
It includes data understandong and exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and training.


## Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures prediction accuracy.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Evaluates average error magnitude.
- R-Squared (RÂ²): Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Demonstrates understanding of influential factors.
